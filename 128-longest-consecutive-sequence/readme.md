Problem Description:
The problem is to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array of integers. A consecutive sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number appears next to the previous one (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4]).

Solution Explanation:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        numSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in nums:
            if num - 1 not in numSet:  # Start of a new consecutive sequence
                curLength = 0
                while num + curLength in numSet:  # Count the length of the consecutive sequence
                    curLength += 1
                longest = max(curLength, longest)  # Update the longest length found so far

        return longest
```

1. The solution is defined as a class `Solution` with a method `longestConsecutive`. It takes an unsorted list of integers `nums` and returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence.

2. The function starts by handling a special case: if the input list `nums` is empty, it immediately returns 0, as there are no consecutive elements in an empty list.

3. The code then initializes an empty set `numSet` to store the unique integers from the input list. Using a set allows for O(1) time complexity for checking the presence of elements.

4. The variable `longest` is initialized to 0. It will keep track of the length of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.

5. The code iterates through each element `num` in the input list `nums`.

6. For each element `num`, it checks if `num - 1` exists in the `numSet`. If `num - 1` is not present, it means that `num` is the start of a new consecutive sequence. Otherwise, the loop proceeds to the next number in the list.

7. If `num - 1` is not present in `numSet`, it means that `num` is the start of a new consecutive sequence. The code then enters a loop to count the length of this sequence.

8. The inner loop runs as long as `num + curLength` exists in `numSet`, incrementing `curLength` by 1 at each iteration. This loop effectively counts the length of the consecutive sequence starting from `num`.

9. After the inner loop completes, the code compares the `curLength` with the current `longest` length and updates `longest` to the maximum of these two values.

10. The code continues this process for all elements in the input list, finding the length of the longest consecutive sequence.

11. Finally, the function returns the `longest` length found, representing the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in the input list.

Time Complexity Analysis:

The solution's time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list `nums`. The loop iterates through each element in the list once, and the operations inside the loop (checking for the presence of elements in the set, counting the length of the sequence) all have constant time complexity O(1) due to the use of sets. Hence, the overall time complexity is dominated by the single loop, resulting in O(n).

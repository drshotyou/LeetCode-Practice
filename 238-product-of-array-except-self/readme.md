The given problem is to calculate an output array where each element at index `i` is the product of all elements in the input array `nums` except the element at index `i`. The solution must have a time complexity of O(n) and cannot use division.

Here's the provided solution with explanations:

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        output = [1] * n
        prefix_product = 1

        # Calculate the prefix products
        for i in range(n):
            output[i] *= prefix_product
            prefix_product *= nums[i]
```

- The `productExceptSelf` method is defined within a class named `Solution`. It takes in the input array `nums` and returns the output array.
- The variable `n` is set to the length of the input array `nums`.
- An output array `output` of length `n` is created, initialized with all elements set to 1. This array will store the final products for each index.
- The variable `prefix_product` is initialized to 1. It represents the product of all elements to the left of the current index.
- Next, the code iterates through each index `i` from 0 to `n-1` and calculates the prefix product for each index.
- For each index `i`, the value at `output[i]` is multiplied by the `prefix_product`, and then `prefix_product` is updated by multiplying it with the corresponding element in the input array `nums`.

```python
        suffix_product = 1
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            output[i] *= suffix_product
            suffix_product *= nums[i]

        return output
```

- The variable `suffix_product` is initialized to 1. It represents the product of all elements to the right of the current index.
- The code then iterates through each index `i` in reverse order, starting from `n-1` and going down to 0.
- For each index `i`, the value at `output[i]` is multiplied by the `suffix_product`, and then `suffix_product` is updated by multiplying it with the corresponding element in the input array `nums`.
- Finally, the `output` array is returned, containing the desired result where each element represents the product of all numbers in the input array except the number at that index.

Explanation of notable algorithms and data structures used:

1. Prefix Products: The algorithm utilizes the concept of prefix products. It calculates the product of all elements to the left of the current index, ensuring a time complexity of O(n). This approach helps avoid repetitive calculations when calculating the product of all elements except the number at a particular index.

2. Suffix Products: Similar to prefix products, the algorithm also calculates the product of all elements to the right of the current index using the concept of suffix products. This step is crucial to achieve the final result.

Overall, the provided solution efficiently solves the problem by utilizing prefix and suffix products, allowing it to achieve the required time complexity of O(n) without using division.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the solution and the underlying algorithms and data structures used!

Problem: Check for Duplicates in an Array
Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, nums, the task is to determine if the array contains any duplicate elements. In other words, we need to check if any value in the array appears more than once. The function should return True if there are duplicates, and False otherwise.

Solution Explanation
Approach: Utilizing a Set for Fast Lookups
Python Code:

class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        numsSet = set()

        for n in nums:
            if n in numsSet:
                return True
            else:
                numsSet.add(n)
        return False
Conceptual Overview:

Data Structure Used: Set

A set in Python is a collection data type that is unordered and mutable. It is characterized by two key properties:
Uniqueness: No two elements in a set are identical.
Efficient Lookups: Checking whether an element is in a set is significantly faster compared to a list, typically O(1) in average case complexity.
Algorithm:

Initialization: An empty set numsSet is created. This set will store unique elements from the nums array.
Iteration and Check: The algorithm iterates through each element n in the nums array.
If n is found in numsSet, it means n has already been encountered before, indicating a duplicate. Hence, the function returns True.
If n is not in numsSet, it is added to the set, and the iteration continues.
Termination: If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns False.
Time Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is visited exactly once.
Space Complexity Analysis:

The space complexity is O(N) in the worst case when all elements are distinct, as the set numsSet might end up storing each element from the array.
Educational Notes:
This problem is a classic example of a trade-off between time and space complexity. While we could check for duplicates using nested loops with O(NÂ²) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, using a set improves time efficiency at the cost of additional space.
Understanding the properties of different data structures, like sets, and their impact on algorithm efficiency is crucial in problem-solving and can lead to more optimal solutions.

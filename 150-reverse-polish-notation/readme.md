The problem is to evaluate an arithmetic expression given in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). RPN is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. For example, the expression "3 + 4" in standard notation is written as "3 4 +" in RPN.

Here's an explanation of the code:

    We define a class Solution with a method evalRPN that takes a list of strings tokens as input and returns an integer, which is the result of evaluating the RPN expression.

    We initialize an empty stack called stack. This stack will be used to keep track of operands and intermediate results while processing the RPN expression.

    We iterate through each token in the input list of tokens:

    a. If the token is an operator ('+', '-', '*', or '/'), we pop the top two elements from the stack. These two elements represent the operands for the operator. We perform the corresponding operation and push the result back onto the stack.

    b. If the token is not an operator, it must be an operand (either an integer or another RPN expression). We convert the token to an integer (since the problem specifies that the answer should be an integer) and push it onto the stack.

    After processing all tokens, the final result is stored at the top of the stack. We return this result as the output of the RPN expression evaluation.

The code efficiently evaluates RPN expressions by using a stack to keep track of operands and perform the required operations. It adheres to the rules specified in the problem description, such as truncating division toward zero and handling valid expressions.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the input list. The code processes each token exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case because the stack can contain all the tokens in the input list.

The function spiralOrder takes in a 2D matrix as input and returns a 1D array that contains the elements of the matrix in a spiral order.

The algorithm works by maintaining four pointers top, left, bottom, and right, which represent the boundaries of the matrix. The algorithm traverses the matrix in a clockwise direction, starting from the top-left corner and moving towards the right. The algorithm stops when all elements have been visited.

The main loop condition while top <= bottom and left <= right: ensures that the algorithm continues until all elements have been visited in the spiral order.

The first for loop traverses the top row from left to right, and appends the elements to the ans list.

The top pointer is incremented by 1 to exclude the top row that has already been visited.

The second for loop traverses the right column from top to bottom, and appends the elements to the ans list.

The right pointer is decremented by 1 to exclude the right column that has already been visited.

The if condition ( (top > bottom) or (left > right)) checks if there are any elements remaining to traverse. If not, the loop is terminated using the break statement.

The third for loop traverses the bottom row from right to left, and appends the elements to the ans list.

The bottom pointer is decremented by 1 to exclude the bottom row that has already been visited.

The fourth for loop traverses the left column from bottom to top, and appends the elements to the ans list.

The left pointer is incremented by 1 to exclude the left column that has already been visited.

Finally, the ans list is returned containing all the elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Overall, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(m x n), since it needs to visit each element in the matrix once. The space complexity is also O(m x n), as the size of the ans list is proportional to the number of elements in the matrix.

The provided code implements the Trie data structure, which is a tree-based data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. The Trie class has three methods:

__init__(self): This is the constructor method that initializes the Trie object by creating the root node of the Trie. The root node is an instance of the TrieNode class.

insert(self, word: str) -> None: This method is used to insert a string word into the Trie. The method starts at the root node and iterates through each character in the string. For each character, it checks if the character is already a child of the current node. If it is not, a new node is created and added as a child of the current node. The iteration continues until all characters in the string are processed. Finally, the endOfWord property of the last node in the path is set to True to indicate that a complete word has been inserted into the Trie.

search(self, word: str) -> bool: This method is used to search for a string word in the Trie. The method starts at the root node and iterates through each character in the string. For each character, it checks if the character is a child of the current node. If it is not, the search terminates and returns False. If all characters in the string are processed and there is a node with endOfWord property set to True, the method returns True, indicating that the word is in the Trie.

startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool: This method is used to check if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix. The method starts at the root node and iterates through each character in the prefix. For each character, it checks if the character is a child of the current node. If it is not, the search terminates and returns False. If all characters in the prefix are processed, the method returns True, indicating that there is at least one word in the Trie that has the given prefix.

The TrieNode class has two properties:

children: This is a dictionary that maps a character to its child TrieNode. This property is used to store the children of a TrieNode.

endOfWord: This is a boolean value that is set to True if the node represents the end of a word in the Trie.

The Trie data structure provides a fast and efficient way to store and retrieve strings, particularly for applications such as autocomplete and spellchecker. The time complexity of inserting a word, searching for a word, and checking for a prefix is O(m), where m is the length of the word or prefix. The space complexity of the Trie is O(nm), where n is the number of words in the Trie and m is the length of the longest word. However, the space complexity can be optimized by compressing the Trie, which involves merging nodes with a single child into a single node.

This code implements a solution for inserting a new interval into a given list of non-overlapping intervals while maintaining the sorted order and non-overlapping constraint. It does this by iterating through the intervals list and comparing each interval with the newInterval to determine the appropriate place for insertion.

The input to the function is a list of intervals and a newInterval, both represented as a list of two integers, the start and end of each interval. The output is the updated list of intervals after the insertion.

The algorithm used here is a linear scan of the intervals list, which takes O(n) time where n is the length of intervals. Inside the loop, there are three cases:

If the end of the newInterval is less than the start of the current interval, we have found the position to insert the newInterval. We add the newInterval to the result list and return the remaining intervals as they are since they do not overlap with the newInterval.

If the start of the newInterval is greater than the end of the current interval, we add the current interval to the result list since it does not overlap with the newInterval.

If the current interval overlaps with the newInterval, we merge them by taking the minimum of the start times and maximum of the end times, and update the newInterval accordingly.

After the loop, we add the final merged newInterval to the result list and return it.

The data structure used in this code is a list of lists, where each inner list represents an interval. The algorithm does not use any additional data structures.

Overall, this implementation is efficient and straightforward, with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n) since it uses a new list to store the resulting intervals.

Problem Description:
The problem is to find two lines from the given vertical lines and the x-axis that form a container, such that the container contains the most water. The vertical lines are represented by an integer array `height`, where `height[i]` represents the height of the ith line.

Solution Explanation:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        length = len(height)
        r = length - 1
        mArea = 0

        while l < r:
            curHeight = min(height[l], height[r])
            curArea = (r - l) * curHeight
            mArea = max(mArea, curArea)
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1

        return mArea
```

Explanation of the Solution:

1. The solution is defined as a class `Solution` with a method `maxArea`, which takes in an integer array `height` and returns an integer representing the maximum amount of water the container can store.

2. The variables `l` and `r` are initialized as 0 and `length - 1`, respectively, where `length` is the number of elements in the `height` array. These variables represent the two pointers starting from the left and right ends of the `height` array.

3. The variable `mArea` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum area found so far.

4. The code enters a loop that continues as long as `l` is less than `r`.

5. Inside the loop, the code calculates the current height of the container, represented by `curHeight`, as the minimum of the heights at positions `l` and `r`.

6. The current area of the container, represented by `curArea`, is calculated as the product of the difference between `r` and `l` (the width of the container) and `curHeight` (the height of the container).

7. The code then updates the `mArea` to the maximum of its current value and `curArea`, effectively keeping track of the maximum area found so far.

8. The loop continues by moving the pointers `l` and `r` inward. If the height at position `l` is less than the height at position `r`, the `l` pointer is incremented (moved to the right) to explore potentially greater heights. Otherwise, if the height at position `l` is greater than or equal to the height at position `r`, the `r` pointer is decremented (moved to the left) to explore potentially greater heights.

9. The loop continues until `l` is no longer less than `r`.

10. Finally, the method returns the maximum area `mArea`, which represents the maximum amount of water the container can store.

Time Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the provided solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `height` array. The two-pointer approach ensures that each pointer moves at most n-1 times (since they start from opposite ends and move towards the middle), resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n). The algorithm performs a constant number of operations for each element, so it is considered to be an optimal solution for this problem.

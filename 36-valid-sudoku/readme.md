Problem Description:
The problem is to determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid according to the Sudoku rules:
1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        rows = defaultdict(set)
        cols = defaultdict(set)
        squares = defaultdict(set)

        for r in range(9):
            for c in range(9):
                if board[r][c] == '.':
                    continue
                if (
                    board[r][c] in rows[r] or
                    board[r][c] in cols[c] or
                    board[r][c] in squares[(r//3,c//3)]
                    ):
                    return False
                else:
                    rows[r].add(board[r][c])
                    cols[c].add(board[r][c])
                    squares[(r//3,c//3)].add(board[r][c])
        return True
```


1. The code defines a class named `Solution` with a method `isValidSudoku`, which takes in a 9x9 Sudoku board represented as a list of lists (`board`) and returns a boolean value indicating whether the Sudoku board is valid.

2. Three defaultdicts (`rows`, `cols`, and `squares`) are initialized. defaultdicts are dictionaries that automatically create a default value (in this case, a set) for any key that does not exist. The sets in these defaultdicts will be used to keep track of the digits present in each row, each column, and each 3x3 sub-box (squares) of the Sudoku board.

3. The code uses two nested loops to iterate over all cells of the Sudoku board.

4. For each cell, if the cell contains a digit (not a dot representing an empty cell), the code checks whether the digit violates any of the Sudoku rules.

5. The code checks if the digit is already present in the corresponding row (`rows[r]`), column (`cols[c]`), or 3x3 square (`squares[(r//3, c//3)]`). If the digit is already present in any of these sets, it means that the Sudoku board is invalid, and the function returns `False`.

6. If the digit is not present in any of the corresponding sets, it is added to the sets for the current row, column, and 3x3 square.

7. If the code successfully iterates through all cells of the Sudoku board without encountering any rule violations, it means that the Sudoku board is valid, and the function returns `True`.

Notable Data Structure:
- The use of `defaultdict(set)` simplifies the process of checking for duplicate digits in each row, column, and 3x3 square. It allows efficient constant-time lookups for membership checks, making the algorithm run in O(1) time complexity for each cell in the 9x9 board.

Overall, the provided solution efficiently checks the validity of a Sudoku board by using sets to keep track of digits in rows, columns, and squares, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 square contains the digits 1-9 without repetition. The algorithm runs in O(1) time complexity per cell, resulting in a total time complexity of O(81) or simply O(1) since the board size is fixed.

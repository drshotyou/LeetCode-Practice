This is a solution to the problem of inverting a binary tree. The function invertTree takes in a root parameter which is the root node of the binary tree. The function returns the root node of the inverted binary tree.

The code uses a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree and invert the nodes. The base case for the recursion is when the root parameter is None, in which case the function returns None. Otherwise, the function swaps the left and right children of the current node, then recursively calls itself on each of the new children.

The code starts by checking if root is not None with the if root statement. If root is not None, then the code proceeds to swap the left and right children of the current node by first storing the left child in a temporary variable tmp. Then, the left child is assigned to be the right child and the right child is assigned to be the left child, effectively swapping the children.

After swapping the children, the function calls itself recursively on the new left and right children with self.invertTree(root.left) and self.invertTree(root.right), respectively. This ensures that the entire binary tree is traversed and all nodes are swapped.

Finally, the function returns the root node of the inverted binary tree by returning the root parameter.

The TreeNode class is a simple implementation of a node in a binary tree, with attributes val, left, and right. The val attribute stores the value of the node, while left and right store the left and right children of the node, respectively. The __init__ method is used to initialize these attributes with default values of 0 for val and None for left and right.

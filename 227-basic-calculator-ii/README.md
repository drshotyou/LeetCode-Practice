The code implements a stack-based approach to evaluate a given mathematical expression represented as a string. The approach uses a stack to keep track of the operands and operators as they are encountered in the expression.

The calculate function takes a string s as input and returns an integer value representing the result of evaluating the expression. The function starts by initializing an empty stack, stack, an integer variable cur to keep track of the current operand being parsed, and an operator op to keep track of the current operator being processed.

The expression string s is then cleaned up by removing any white spaces using the replace function. The function then loops through each character in the expression string s, and performs the following operations:

If the current character is a digit, it is added to the current operand being parsed cur. If the current character is not a digit, the current operand cur is complete, and it is processed based on the current operator op as follows:

If the current operator is +, the current operand cur is added to the stack.

If the current operator is -, the negative of the current operand -cur is added to the stack.

If the current operator is *, the top of the stack is popped and multiplied by the current operand cur, and the result is added back to the stack.

If the current operator is /, the top of the stack is popped and divided by the current operand cur. The result is then truncated towards zero using the int function and added back to the stack.

The current operand cur is reset to zero, and the current operator op is updated to the current character i.

After the loop completes, the stack contains the final result of the expression, which is obtained by summing all the values in the stack using the sum function.

This algorithm uses a stack data structure to process the expression string in a linear fashion. The stack allows for the efficient processing of the operands and operators while preserving the order of the expression. The use of the stack also allows for the proper handling of operator precedence and ensures that the expressions are evaluated correctly.

One important detail to note is that the code implements integer division that truncates towards zero using the int function. This is in contrast to the floating-point division that is performed by default in most programming languages. Therefore, the code may produce different results compared to other implementations that use floating-point division when evaluating expressions.

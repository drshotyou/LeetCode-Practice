The problem statement asks us to determine if a given string containing only six types of brackets - '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']' - is valid or not. A string is considered valid if it meets the following criteria:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
Here's an explanation of the code:

We start by defining a class Solution with a method isValid that takes a string s as input and returns a boolean value (True if the string is valid, False otherwise).

We initialize an empty list called stack. This stack will be used to keep track of open brackets encountered in the string.

We then iterate through each character c in the input string s.

Inside the loop, we check if c is an open bracket ('(', '[', or '{'). If it is, we push it onto the stack.

If c is not an open bracket, we check if the stack is not empty (i.e., it contains open brackets) and whether the current character c corresponds to the correct closing bracket for the top element of the stack. If this condition is met, we pop the top element from the stack, indicating that the corresponding open bracket has been found.

If the condition in step 5 is not met, we return False immediately because the string is not valid.

After processing all characters in the string, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, this means that all open brackets have been correctly matched and closed, and we return True. Otherwise, we return False.

The code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the open brackets encountered in the string. It ensures that each closing bracket is matched with the correct corresponding opening bracket in the correct order. If at any point the string becomes invalid (e.g., a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket), it returns False. Otherwise, if the stack is empty at the end, it returns True, indicating that the string is valid.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s, as it iterates through each character once. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, where all characters are open brackets and are pushed onto the stack.

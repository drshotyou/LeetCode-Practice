Problem Description:
The problem is to find two numbers in a sorted array `numbers` such that they add up to a specific target `target`. The array is 1-indexed, and the solution is required to return the indices of the two numbers, added by one, as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and there is exactly one solution. The solution must use only constant extra space.

Solution Explanation:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left = 0 
        right = len(numbers) - 1

        while left < right:
            sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
            if sum == target:
                return [left+1, right+1]
            elif sum < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
```

Explanation of the Solution:

1. The solution is defined as a class `Solution` with a method `twoSum`, which takes an integer array `numbers` and an integer `target` as inputs and returns an integer array containing the indices of two numbers that add up to the target.

2. The variable `left` is initialized to 0, representing the left pointer starting from the beginning of the `numbers` array.

3. The variable `right` is initialized to `len(numbers) - 1`, representing the right pointer starting from the end of the `numbers` array.

4. The code enters a loop that continues as long as `left` is less than `right`.

5. Inside the loop, the code calculates the sum of the numbers at positions `left` and `right`, represented by the variable `sum`.

6. The code then checks if `sum` is equal to the `target`. If it is equal, it means that the two numbers at positions `left` and `right` add up to the target, and the method immediately returns the indices `[left+1, right+1]`. The indices are incremented by one because the array is 1-indexed.

7. If the `sum` is less than the `target`, it means that the sum needs to be increased. The left pointer `left` is incremented (moved to the right) to explore potentially larger sums.

8. If the `sum` is greater than the `target`, it means that the sum needs to be decreased. The right pointer `right` is decremented (moved to the left) to explore potentially smaller sums.

9. The loop continues until `left` is no longer less than `right`.

10. If the loop completes without finding a solution, it means that there is exactly one solution (as mentioned in the problem description), so the method is guaranteed to return a valid result.

Time Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the provided solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `numbers` array. The two-pointer approach ensures that each pointer moves at most n-1 times (since they start from opposite ends and move towards the middle), resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n). The algorithm performs a constant number of operations for each element, so it is considered to be an optimal solution for this problem. Additionally, the solution satisfies the constant extra space requirement as it only uses a few integer variables, and it does not require any additional data structures proportional to the input size.

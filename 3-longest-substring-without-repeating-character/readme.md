Problem Description:
The problem is to find the length of the longest substring in a given string `s` without any repeating characters.

Solution Explanation:

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        window = set()
        l = 0
        r = 0
        length = len(s)
        ans = 0

        while r < length:
            while s[r] in window:
                window.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
            window.add(s[r])
            if (r - l + 1) > ans: 
                ans = r - l + 1
            r += 1

        return ans
```

Explanation of the Solution:

1. The solution is defined as a class `Solution` with a method `lengthOfLongestSubstring`, which takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer representing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

2. The `window` is initialized as an empty set, which will be used to keep track of characters in the current window (substring) being considered.

3. The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to 0, which represent the left and right pointers of the window, respectively. The window will start with both pointers at the beginning of the string `s`.

4. The variable `length` is set to the length of the input string `s`.

5. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the longest substring without repeating characters found so far.

6. The code enters a loop that continues as long as the right pointer `r` is less than the length of the string `s`.

7. Inside the loop, the code checks if the character at position `r` is already present in the `window`. If it is, it means we have found a repeating character in the current window.

8. In such cases, we remove characters from the left side of the window until we eliminate the repeating character. We increment the left pointer `l` and remove the character `s[l]` from the `window` set in each iteration of the inner while loop until the character at position `r` is no longer in the `window`.

9. After eliminating the repeating character, we add the character at position `r` to the `window` set.

10. We calculate the length of the current window (substring) as `(r - l + 1)` and compare it with the current `ans`. If the current window's length is greater than `ans`, we update `ans` to the length of the current window.

11. We then move the right pointer `r` to the next character, expanding the window, and repeat the process until we traverse the entire string.

12. The loop continues until we have checked all possible substrings in the input string `s`.

13. Finally, the method returns the value of `ans`, which represents the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Time Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the provided solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. Both the left and right pointers traverse the string at most once, and each character is processed only once. The `while` loop inside the outer loop ensures that every character is processed once, and the constant time operations performed inside the loop (adding and removing elements from the set, calculating the window length) do not change the overall linear time complexity. Therefore, the algorithm has an optimal time complexity of O(n) for finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

This code solution first initializes an empty list named 'numbers' to store the intermediate numbers generated during the process of determining if a number is happy. It uses a while loop to continue the process until the number 'n' becomes 1. If at any point 'n' is found in the list 'numbers', it means the process is looping endlessly, and the number is not happy, so the function returns False.

Inside the outer while loop, there's an inner while loop that calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of the number 'n'. It does this by first extracting the last digit using the modulo operator, then updating 'n' to remove the last digit using integer division, and finally adding the square of the extracted digit to a variable named 'total'. This process continues until all the digits of 'n' are processed.

Once the inner loop finishes, the variable 'n' is updated with the value of 'total', and the outer loop continues checking if 'n' is now 1 or if it already exists in the list 'numbers'. If the outer loop terminates because 'n' becomes 1, the function returns True, indicating that the number is happy.
